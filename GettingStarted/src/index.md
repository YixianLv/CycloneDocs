# CycloneDDS Getting Started


<img src="figs/Cyclone_DDS-Logo.png" width = 400 /> 

Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust OMG compliant Data Distribution Service (DDS) implementation. Cyclone DDS core is implemented in C and provides C-APIs to applications. Through its Cyclonedds-cxx package, the ISO/IEC C++ 2003 language binding is supported.
