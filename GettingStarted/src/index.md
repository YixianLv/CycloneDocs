# CycloneDDS Getting Started


<img src="figs/Cyclone_DDS-Logo.png" width = 400 /> 

Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust OMG compliant Data Distribution Service (DDS) implementation. Cyclone DDS core is implemented in C and provides C-APIs to applications. Through its Cyclonedds-cxx package, the ISO/IEC C++ 2003 language binding is supported.

The first chapters detail the installation and build process of Cyclone Core, including the C-APIs. The remaining chapters details how to install the C++ support packages. Short tutorials in C and C++ are detailed to give the reader the first impression on how the DDS technology is used with Cyclone to share data.
